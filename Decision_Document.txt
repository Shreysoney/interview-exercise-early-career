Going through the requirements I first divided the whole problem into small tasks and then integerated them all together.

First I went through the code provided and then went over the features that need to be implemented
Initially starting with the input string I added the validator there and then implemented the function 
that was mentioned in the document.

After that I went through stats part where I implemented other functions and checked if they are working properly or not. I started from the basic approach to code and then after when it worked perfectly I  started thinking how I can improve it so I created one function named as maxOccuringItem so that I could write the code once instead of repeating the code. 

For longeststring and longestpalindrome I was initially thinking to store each and every value in list but that would just increase the space. Therefore I used only one variable for each that compares and stores the result every time 
we input a string

I then went through palindrome function that was from developers choice.

Then finally I checked the exit part of code and then merged my all together and then checked if it was working perfectly or not.
